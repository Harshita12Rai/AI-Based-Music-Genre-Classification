# AI-Based Music Genre Classification
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline that classifies music genres from raw audio files.

## About the Project
This project showcases the development and deployment of a machine learning model for classifying music genres, demonstrating a strong command of data science principles and the ability to build a functional deep learning application from the ground up. At its core, the system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, meticulously engineered and trained on the extensive GTZAN dataset. This model achieves a high classification accuracy of 89%, a testament to a solid understanding of model architecture, training, and optimization.

Beyond the model, this project highlights key skills in handling raw audio data, preprocessing it for machine learning consumption, and integrating the trained model into a user-friendly application. The web interface, built with Streamlit, provides a seamless, real-time prediction experience, allowing users to upload audio files and receive an instant genre classification. This demonstrates practical front-end development and deployment skills. The entire project serves as a clear example of logical problem-solving and the application of machine learning concepts to a real-world challenge, making it a powerful portfolio piece for showcasing technical proficiency to recruiters and hiring managers.
